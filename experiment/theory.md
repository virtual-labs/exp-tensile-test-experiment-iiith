 The tensile test is a test performed to know the ductility of the particular material. In practical, the test is carried out on universal testing machine (also called the UTM). When tension is applied to a particular member, the stresses are developed in the member at the centre. At a particular point of time during the testing, the member breaks.

Young’s modulus: Young’s modulus is defined as the ratio of stress to strain. It is denoted by ‘E’. 1. Young's Modulus (Modulus of Elasticity) In the region on the stress-strain curve where the stress changes linearly with the strain, the Young’s modulus (Modulus of elasticity, E) is defined as the ratio of stress and strain. Value of the Young’s modulus is a constant for a given material.
