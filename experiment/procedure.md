**Procedure**

1. The load pointer is set at zero by adjusting the initial setting mode.
2. The dial gauge is fixed for measuring elongation of small amounts.
3. Measure the diameter of the test piece with the help of a vernier calliper and determine the mean value. Also mark the gauge length.
4. Now the specimen is gripped between the upper and middle cross head jaws of the machine.
5. Start the machine and the specimen is gradually loaded. Note down the load and its corresponding dial gauge reading. The observations are taken until the specimen breaks.
6. Plot the graph between stress and strain.


**Virtual Procedure**
1. Choose the material of the specimen for the experiment from the tab.
2. Start the Experiment by clicking the play button.
3. Observe the extension of rod in the simulation window.
4. As the simulation continues the different value of stress, strain and elongation are observed according to the increasing Load.
5. A Graph is plotted between the stress-strain values observed.
6. A Comparison tab is provided to compare the stress-strains curves of different materials.
7. The Experiment allows you to pause/play/restart the simulation to view the values of different parameters at every stage of simulation.

NOTE: There are various features available for the graphs such as zoom, etc. The function/feature of each icon above the graphs becomes visible upon hovering over the concerned icon.
