 Procedure for the experiment is as follows.

1. The load pointer is set at zero by adjusting the initial the initial setting mode.
2. The dial gauge is fixed for measuring elongation of small amounts.
3. Measure the diameter of the test piece with the help of a vernier calliper at least at three pieces and determine the mean value. Also mark the gauge length.
4. Now the specimen is gripped between the upper and middle cross head jaws of the machine.
5. Start the machine and the specimen is gradually loaded. Note down the load and its corresponding dial gauge reading. The observations are taken until the specimen breaks
6. Plot the graph between stress vs. strain.
