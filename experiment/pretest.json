                "e": "Proportionality limit is where till the hookes law is valid and stress is directly proportional to the strain.  "

            "answers": {
                "a": "the least amount of stress that can be held without permanent deformation",
                "b": "highest stress a material can experience without permanent deformation",
                "c": "average stress experienced by material in its lifeline.",

            },
            "explanations": {
                "b": "The elastic limit is the highest stress that a material can withstand, without permanent deformation present when the stress is released completely. It is not the lowest amount of stress present."

                "a": "The brittle materials are weak in tension. The malleable materials are to be hammered into thin sheets. The plasticity is a property where there will be huge strain with almost slight application of load. The tensile test is conducted on the ductile materials."
